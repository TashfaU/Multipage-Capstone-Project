      <li>They are poached for illegal trade.</li>
      <li>Habitat loss is occuring due to human population increase and land expansion.</li>
      <li>Climate change affects a lot of ecosystems negatively. Snow Leopards live in cold enviroments and climate change is causing extreme weather events and shrinking the alpine zone where Snow Leopards live.</li> 
      <li>Snow Leopards are experiencing human-wildlife conflict because there is a decrease in their food which is causing them to turn to domesticated livestock. Humans will kill Snow Leopards to save their livestock.</li>
      <li>There is a decrease in their prey because humans are overhunting their prey.</li>
