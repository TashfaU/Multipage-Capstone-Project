<p>Snow Leopards also know as Ounce and nicknamed "ghost of the mountains" are found across Northern and Central Asia, including the Himalaya's. Snow Leopards live in 12 countries some of which are; China, Bhutan, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Russia, and Mongolia. They live in high altitude mountanious terrain, at elevations of 3,000-4,500m. They can live for 15-18 years in the wild. Snow Leopards are considered endangered. They are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List and there are estimated to be less than 10,000 Snow Leopards in the world today. Snow Leopards have white and greyish fur that helps keep them insulated in the cold weather. Also, their tail is 80-105cm. Theur tail is thick due to fat storage, and is covered in thick layer of fur, so when its wrapped around the Leopards body it gives it warmth. Snow Leopards are really well camouflaged and hard to identify compared to big cats like jaguars, lion and other Leopards, but despite this they are hunted and killed. Snow Leopards cannot roar but they meow, growl, yowl and chuff also known as prusten. A yowl is so loud it can be hear over the roar of a river. A chuff on the other hand, is a low-intensity and not-threatening sound. Snow Leopards are carnivores and eat blue sheep, argali, sheep, ibex, deer, wild boar, and other small mammals like rat, mouse and squirrel. They eat domesticated animals too when its hard to hunt in the wild. Despite being carnivores they eat grass and twigs. Snow Leopards can mate at the age of 3. They usually mate in late winter and the cubs are born between April and June. The cubs are blind at birth, but have thick fur and weigh from 320 to 567g. Their eyes open at seven days old, they can walk at five weeks and are fully weaned by 10 weeks. They leave the den when they are around two to four months and part from their mother at 20-21 months.
